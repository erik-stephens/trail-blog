title: DAY 22 - Highline Trail

This section of the trail is called the Highline Trail - tons of great views of the rim. The trail was really fun. One minute strolling through pines then the next scrambling over red rock then another cooling off by a creek and then back again. A good mix of elevation changes kept it exciting without being too technical nor punishing.

Met a cool cat near the start where we shared a salad and chatted for a couple of hours. And Sean reached out to some friends, Danny & Casey, in Pine that were gracious enough to host me on such short notice. We got to share good beers & food at THAT Brewery which has been a much anticipated stop for weeks.

Today marks the start of week 4. Slowly but surely, I'm finding my stride. Feeling the flow. Doing the bull dance. Also shedding some fears: failure, the unknown, snakes, spiders, and things that go bump in the night.

Next few days will be along east of the Verde River and through the Mazatzal range. I hope to be relaxing in Apache Lake this time next week.
