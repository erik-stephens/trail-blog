DAYS 19 & 20 - Cabin "Fever"

Since the last day was such a bust on mileage & foot pain, today had to be a 30+ mile grind in order to make it to my buddy Sean for a homemade meal, good company, and a warm bed. Thank you, trail angels, for letting me CRASH your pad! That's Gatlin, Aunt Jan, Sean, Ollie, Tara, April, Uncle Fred, and Henry.

The first 10 miles or so coming down from Mormon Mtn was a gentle trail that was pleasant on the eyes, but feet were already starting to flare up. Was thinking I'd miss my window...

After a quick nap at noon, I felt recharged enough to try to make those last 20 miles by 8pm.  Surprisingly, jogging felt much better on the feet, less jarring. Armed with that knowledge, all the bear scat, and Tool queued up, I made good progress. It helped to pretend that a bear was in hot pursuit and that tonight looked like a horrible night for a curse (a Castlevania reference inspired by the burnt landscape & smoky sky).

That last mile seemed to take forever - it had me cursing up a storm. That faded immediately when Sean tossed me a cold one.

I'm ultra grateful I didn't injure myself - was worried something in my feet would tear, pop, or break. Taking a 0 day to hang with friends and rest my dogs. Next stop: Mogollon Rim.
