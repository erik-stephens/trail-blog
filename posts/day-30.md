DAY 30 - Bushwhacked

Stop me if you've heard this one before: Erik hikes at night, Erik loses trail, Erik cries himself to sleep. Well, I would've been crying if I'd known that I set myself up for a day of bushwhacking.

I felt so proud the night before about how much & how high I traveled in the dark only to realize I had lost the trail a few miles back. The dirt road I was on seemed to be heading back towards the trail, so I took it another few miles in the morning. By that point, it was clear that it would spit me back down to Apache Lake. I was too committed mileage-wise to backtrack, so I chose to blaze up the ridge. Looked easy enough, just 1-2 miles down & up a creek bed - those look so tranquil from afar until get face to face with the dense brush.

The thing about blazing up a ridge is that every step commits you even more to a potentially very bad idea, because as much of a grind to climb and scrape through gnarly brush, aborting means having to experience that unpleasantness a 2nd time on the way back. Also, there's no guarantee there is a feasible way to your destination. This was the 2nd most dangerous climb of my life and I'm ultra thankful that I made it. Oh, and for the cloudy, breezy day!

My reward for ascending the ridge and getting back on trail was a sea of dead thistle. That golden color wasn't looking so cool then. The plants that are thriving post-fire are lame, thorny shrubs that don't know when to quit. That's why I like cacti - they're content to simply chill in their lane.

After a day of cursing and crying for my mommie, I finally made it to Reavis Ranch around 9pm. It was a magical oasis: cool & moist with the fragrance of apples in the air.
