DAY 46 - Parker Canyon Lake

Now that I can see the finish line, or at least the last mtn range, I'm pumped to git-r-done. It was cool to be able to see the Superstitions, Mt Lemmon, Mica Mtn, Mt Wrightson, and Miller Peak all from the same vantage point.

In my haste to get the heck outta Patagonia, I forgot to camel up. Once again, the water angels came through. After eating breakfast and cameling up at the water tanks, I channeled my inner antelope and beasted through. Didn't stop for pics cuz it's hard with cloven hooves ðŸ¤ª

Saw a couple of immigration officers on ATV's supposedly responding to a 911 call. I have a ton of respect for those that were able accomplish treking across the border. I'm talking about the physical & mental feat - no politics. I'm struggling and I have a cell phone, plenty of food & water, and support if things go sideways on me. When in towns, I only have to avoid the occasional crazy bum, not an entire team of people out looking for me. My step father did it not once but twice back in the 80's - RESPECT!

Only 20 miles to the finish but I have Miller Peak to battle at the end ðŸ¤ž
