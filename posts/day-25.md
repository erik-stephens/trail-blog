DAY 25 - Out of Focus

Fell behind on posts cuz I had no signal and barely had enough battery to make it to Sunflower...

Today was a slog up, down, and around ridges. Wouldn't have lugged so much water if I had known how awesome the water sources are here. Started to feel the heat, but there were enough spots with shade to rest at. Mazatzal is more green than I expected. Saw my first tarantula in the wild.

Today's theme was focusing on the trail. Before starting the AZT, I had expectations that I'd have so much time for thought. Things like:

- Figuring out the meaning of life. Is it "one step at a time"? ðŸ˜‰

- Hashing out the details of the next big tech idea, or at the very least a cool name like AviÃ¡to.

- Outline my epic sci-fi novel.

Thus far, when I do have some time to think, it's usually about food. I almost never crave food - put a plate in front of me and I'll eat it - but I'd have little food fantasies of all the things I'd eat when back in civilization.

I guess it's been helpful not having much time to obsess about food. I've been having to focus on the trail, especially in Mazatzal with all the ridge walking. One wrong step and it's a twisted ankle or slipping down the ridge into some gnarly brush or rocks.

Then there's the focus needed to simply stay on the trail. I completely spaced a trail junction and almost went down the wrong side of the ridge. Luckily, that was only a mile of backtracking. Another time, I went down a creek bed that mirrored the trail just enough to fool you. I decided to bushwhack through thick desert scrub instead of backtracking - probably the wrong choice.
