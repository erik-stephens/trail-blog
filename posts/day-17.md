DAY 17 - The Wizard

I met 1st thru hiker (trail name Tinker). People thought I was crazy to start in the "summer" - he started mid August northbound (NOBO)! Will take many years to catch up to the likes of him: he's already done the PCT & AT (planning another trip at spry age of 75 next year) and I doubt I'll ever grow an epic beard as that!

Passed by a small telescope array just past Marshall Lake which a couple of you may find interesting.

The Peaks are long behind me now. Still freezing cold - looking forward to being back in the desert, sort of ðŸ¤ž
