DAY 29 - Welcome to the Desert

With a stuffed belly my brother dropped me off at the Vineyard Trailhead (Theodore Roosevelt Dam). The 40 miles of trail twix Sunflower and here are closed due to the Bighorn Fire ☹️

Glad I started around 3pm to take it easy in the new locale - I can definitely notice the difference. With a fresh supply of food, the pack is heavy again, so only did 10 miles, enough to get back to higher elevation. Good news is that the water sources are plentiful and the cows are happy.

A large fire last year in the Superstitions caused a lot of damage. Thus far, the damage hasn't been very noticeable. The desert is rocking a cool golden green palette.
