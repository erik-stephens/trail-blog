DAY 44 - Kentucky Camp

Woke up to some strange things in the sky and a weird sensation on my skin: clouds & wind 😁

Even after plenty of food, water, and sleep, I still felt gassed trying to make first water source 8 miles away. Finally reached it just before 10am thinking no chance of making up yesterday's miles by end of the day.

Even though it was a beautiful cow tank with cool, clear water. I chose to hike through the day since I wasn't getting much rest doing the "wait out the sun" thing. I don't know if it was the music or if they put something in the cow water, but I balled pretty hard, so hard even the cacti were high-fiving me 🤪

I made Kentucky Camp at 3pm, enough time to recharge the batteries and get another 7 miles in before camp. I'm set up pretty nicely to make Patagonia at a decent hour tomorrow. For those that like historic places (@austingodber ?), Kentucky Camp & its surrounding trails might be worth a visit . It's reachable by dirt road. For me, it was sooo nice to relax in a rocking chair and skim the old books for a bit.
