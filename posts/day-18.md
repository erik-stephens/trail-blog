DAY 18 - Too Much Tuna

Fresh food turned out to be a double-edged sword. While it was great to be eating less processed food, it weighs considerably more per calorie. The SLT (spam, lettuce, tomato sandwich) is a recipe courtesy of my bro - was delish. And, yes, lugging a bottle of Miracle Whip was so worth it - come at me with Zest or don't come at all üòÅ

My month old buried resupply held up - no critters got to it. My timing was a bit off, though. Had too much food and didn't want to throw any away. That meant water in one hand and food in another, which meant unable to use trekking poles (more like crutches) and my feet had to pay an extra tax. Only logged about 15 miles, which means 30+ tomorrow if I want to sleep in a warm bed.
