Considering how relatively lush Reavis Ranch is, I was expecting tons of insects but hardly any bugged me during the night. Cowboy camping under the stars is romantic (and simple), but I admit that I'm missing the security of a tent.

Got to see the ranch now that there was light. Immediately went looking for the source of apple fragrance. Didn't find but did find a pear tree. Everything within a few hundred feet of the creek survived last year's fire, but the surrounding area was toast. Having a 25+ mile day to Superior had me outta there earlier than I liked. Will have to visit again and spend multiple nights, maybe plant some seeds and work the land a bit.

Fortunately, the trail was much better than yesterday's but there still were plenty of times I had to keep the trail app open to use as a guide. After just a few miles, it was back in hot desert, this time with full sun, no wind, and only one promising water source. Luckily, I happened to spy a small pool of water in the creek bed out of the corner of my eye. How this water still existed is a minor miracle, especially since my expected water source was a dud. The few times I ran outta water this journey, I was so f'ing fortunate/blessed to find water shortly afterwards, and this time was extra special.

Finally ran across (literally) my first rattler this trek. Was jogging down a wash near sunset and we scared each other pretty good.
