"On the trail again..." Day 11 was a veg out day. We raided the local thrift stores, always an exciting time when visiting a new locale. Managed to find some stuff for my kit: hat, shirt, poles.

This section of the trail continues to surprise me in that still haven't hit high desert terrain yet. Pretty sure it's on the menu tomorrow.

Posted short, unedited video to give a sense of night hiking. For a nervous guy like me, it feels a bit like that Blair Witch Project movie, especially when all of a sudden you see eyes glowing back at you or an elk cry out. No chance of me being able to keep it together if there were serious wildlife out here ðŸ˜¬
