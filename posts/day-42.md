title: DAY 42 - Food

End of week 6 with only one more until the finish line! Vail is a nice enough place with good people, but let's face it, it's a suburb. Thought now would be a good time to chat food.

Passing my 40 days 40 nights biblical target got me thinking way too much about all the food gluttony I'd want to indulge in while in town. I had to be strategic about it so as not to shock my body. When at Uncle Fred's up in Happy Jack for a couple of nights, I gorged on way too much food and not enough water. I completely passed out - I'm talking a trust fall to the floor with no one to catch me ðŸ¥´ I managed much better here and in Summerhaven. Paced myself and made sure to keep drinking water with electrolyte tablets.

I left the restaurant around 5:30pm and didn't make it back to the trail until after dark. This was where my final resupply was buried. I relied a bit too much on my memory, something "between two ocotillos" was only thing coming back to me. Well, there were a ton of ocotillos and trying to find the special two at night proved quite the treasure hunt. I got lucky yet again this trek: my water was there and only a few casualties in the food cache: my trail mix, a ramen, and some oatmeal. The important things like the chips & chipotle bowl survived.

Even though you get sick of eating the same old food after 40 days, there are some things that I think I'll add to my civilian diet: instant breakfast shakes, shots of vinegar+honey+tumeric after a meal, and that chipotle bowl. It's vegetarian but if you squint hard enough then you can pretend you're eating chicken. Plus, it's one of the few packaged meals that brings the spice (looking at you bland AF Knorr Sides).

Enough rambling for me. Let me know your favorite trail/camping foods. Bonus points if doesn't need refrigeration and is simple to prepare.

Oh, last thing, I slept under the I-10 - the nicest underpass I've ever seen even if the exterior is scary.
