"I STRONG! ME LIKE ROCK! I CLIMB NOW! HUR DUR HUR..."

That was my inner monologue while debating whether to go up South Kaibab or Bright Angel and the awesome rangers at Phantom Ranch asked me if I would like to stay at one of the camp sites. Didn't take long for me to swallow my pride and graciously accept.

Funny how this same time yesterday I was having a nice little pity party for myself about how all the campgrounds were closed and I'd have to slog my way through a rim to rim plus another 7 miles to Tusayan.

Got to spend the afternoon & night exploring Phantom Ranch and the Colorado River. I barely saw any other visitors, almost like being in an amusement park where only you are admitted - surreal!

So, yeah, I felt like won the lottery today. Descending North Kaibab was really steep and cool the first 6 miles or so. The next 7 were mostly flat, following Bright Angel Creek until it joined with the Colorado. I was feeling pressure to rush through that section since it becomes like an oven as the sun warms the canyon walls.

The pics don't do this place justice, something you must see with your own eyes. Reminds me of Paris, where nearly every corner & angle has something cool to show you. And I'm in awe of the trailblazers & engineers that made it so a jabroney like me can experience this üòÅ
