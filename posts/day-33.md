After a relatively decent night's sleep and plenty of food & water, I thought the 9 miles to Gila River would be a breeze. Didn't help that I was still hauling 4-5 liters of water just in case the river was bone dry. Pulled in before 11am just as I was starting to bonk.

The water was mostly knee high. It was brown but it filtered just fine. Most importantly, it was cool & shady. WOOT! Spent a relaxing 5 hours napping, washing the funk off me, and de-thistling my footwear.

Chose to walk along the railroad tracks instead of the trail, primarily for nostalgia's sake, but also to conserve battery. I need the spotlight mode when on the narrow trail with grass that could be hiding rattlers. I could use the low power red light on something more safe like the tracks, but I simply relied on the half moonlight, at least until a couple of rattlers warned me otherwise! The first one wasn't too scary, giving me plenty of warning.  The second one was coiled up and didn't rattle until I was already next to it.

After that jolt, I stopped caring about battery and started using my poles like a blind man. Even with the rails as some security, I was still nervous.

Made camp in a wash next to the tracks. I hope the ants accept my peace offering and let me sleep in peace.

Saying goodbye to foothills for the next few days until Mt Lemon. My battery won't last another 2 nights, so thinking about plan B...
