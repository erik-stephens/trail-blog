The sun has set on my AZT thru hike. This last passage was really cool. A steep climb and a nice chunk along the crest which was gentle. It even had a bath 🤪 The descent was pleasant, spending a lot of time in nice shade trees along a creek bed.

I didn't risk sneaking the mile or so to snap a selfie at the southern terminus monument that is now closed for beefing up the border. I'm whiter than sour cream but I also have the kind of face that LE would love to punch. 

Can't wait to get home and take a bath (or three)! I think I have a couple of more AZT related posts in me and then I promise to shut up about it 😁 Wanted to keep this one short & sweet so I can get busy fattening back up 🍺🥧
