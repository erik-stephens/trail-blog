DAYS 5-7 - Stomach Shock

Found a friend at one of the water sources. He woke me up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and continued to be annoying throughout the day. Since he gave no indication of leaving me, I thought best for us to get a room for a couple of nights so that we could get better acquainted. I fed him all kinds of things to try to satisfy him - I think raw garlic was his favorite. I think we're buds now, which is good, cuz I didn't want to have to nuke my micro biome with antibiotics.

Slogged 12 miles to Grand Canyon visitor center hoping for cell signal (or wifi), real food, and a shuttle. Struck out on all of those. Was lucky to hitch a ride to Kaibab Lodge 20 miles away. Still no cell signal, but at least they had a pay phone so I could let fam know I'm ok. It's been a kind of time warp: pay phones, paper maps, talking to people instead of googling.

This down time had me reflecting on things I take for granted. There are the obvious ones like clean water, a warm bath & bed, warm & wholesome food, internet access. Some not so obvious ones:

- A garbage can. Hauling smelly sardine cans and empty water containers gets really annoying after a couple of days.

- A chair. A decent sized log or rock was a sight for sore legs. Picnic tables are bliss since don't have to hunch over my pack.

- Pickup trucks. I would only ask for a hitch from trucks, thinking more covid friendly to just jump in the back. I only saw 2. Also, I learned that it's illegal in AZ to stick your thumb out when hitching. That's the 2nd time in 2 weeks where I discovered that sticking your thumb out can be offensive or illegal ðŸ¤”

That was a lot of rambling. I think I'm ready to hit the trail again in the morning. Next stop: South Rim! ðŸ¤ž
