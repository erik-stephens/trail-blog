Nothing too exciting today other than being saved by trail angels that left water. Without that, I would've been desperate 😬

Finally outta desert scrubs and in the shadow of Snow Bowl. Had my first warm meal on the trail - cold, slightly undone ramen ain't no fun.

One of these days I'll give up my Fancy Feast alcohol stove for something with more power and less fuss. I just wanted to be non-conformist to be "cool" 😁
