title: DAY 43 - Perspective, Attitude, Altitude

Start of week 7 started well. Even though Mt Wrightson looked so far away and the pack was heavy with food & water, turning around to see how far Mica Mtn was behind me gave me confidence that would ONLY be a day or so ðŸ¤ž

Every day since Summerhaven, I've been telling myself "It's all downhill & smooth sailing from here." I gotta stop doing that since there's plenty of rugged terrain & elevation change left.

The first 10 miles or so were smooth, gentle mountain bike track. Once in the foothills, things were much more gnarly and had me feeling like that turtle. I ended up stopping 8 miles short of my target which means an even more grueling tomorrow.

In general and especially on this trek, I've been saying "Mom was right! I should've trusted her judgment more!" I didn't make that mistake with her avocado blister balm idea. The skin protected surprisingly well and I think the residual avocado had a soothing & healing effect. Blisters are mostly healed by now, but I'm still being extra protective with the makeshift toe gloves and swapping socks out once feet get too sweaty.

Patagonia seems so far away still ðŸ˜­
