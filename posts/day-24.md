After trippin' down Rocky Road in the morning, I arrived at East Verde River just in time for a water refill, swim, lunch, and a siesta. Lazed around this desert oasis waiting for the sun to start to dip before a 2000 ft climb outta the canyon. It was so nice that I almost stayed the night. I'm sure the insects would've loved my company 😁

Thought I was outta bear county, but pretty sure that I heard one crashing through the desert scrub - there was grunting, it moved way too fast for a cow, and sounded much larger than a javelina. Whatever it was, glad it didn't feel obliged to introduce itself 😬

The horses weren't shy. I may not be a smart man, but I know not to try to take a selfie with a horse - liable to end up with my ear bit off. As the ol' saying goes: never look a gift horse in the eye 😉

At least the water sources have delivered, much more so than up north surprisingly. The bad news is that water is heavy.

A lot going on these last couple of days, so gonna break it up into multiple posts when I get more down time, shade, and signal.
