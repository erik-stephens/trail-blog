Spent these days stuffing my face with food, resting my feet, and taking care of some real world business. Spent a night at Apache Lake with my bro who is helping me out a ton with the logistical support. I started the trail at 150 pounds and weighed in at 140! I look really weird: big head on small, veiny body - not good.

The skunks, vultures, and bees kept us company ðŸ˜¬ Other than that, the lake was oddly quiet, but in a nice peaceful way.

Getting back on the trail again, 50 miles to Superior. Gonna be hot, and unlike Mazatzal, I doubt there'll be much shade.
