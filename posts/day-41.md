Woke up to a nice sunrise after a warmer night than expected. Hit Italian Spring with the birds just before summit.  The summit was not scenic, surprisingly flat pine forest. However, a short side trip to Spud Rock had all the views.

Did a good job with food packing this stretch - just enough left to get me to Vail and my final buried resupply. This means pack was really light, allowing me to bomb down the mountain to get into Vail's shadow.

While the ascent up the north side was steep and borderline bushwhacky, the descent down the south side was soft and well groomed which my blisters & joints appreciated.

I practically stepped on one rattler which I never saw. The 2nd one was easy to spot splayed across the trail. He had a cool green coloring which I'd never seen before.

I missed a trail junction which left me faced with private property yet again (
