title: DAYS 36-37 - Flamed Out

The start of week 6!

I think I jinxed myself yesterday by thinking the most grueling sections were behind me: a big blister, a long ascent with no good water sources, and a resupplied pack were on the menu today. Luckily I found some Neosporin and gloves along the hwy to Oracle for dressing my blisters.

Since the trail up to Summerhaven is closed due to the Bighorn Fire, I asked Google if the Mt Lemmon Rd was open. It said yes! It would be about 25 miles instead of the 15 on the trail, but seemed like a fair deal, especially considering my hitching 20 miles two days prior.

I rested at Peppersauce Campground with some deer & coati until 2:30, then hiked as far as my blistered foot would let me. One nice thing about blisters is they motivate you to walk faster (or jog), since going slow only adds to the suffering.

I split the ascent of Mt Lemmon into two 12-13 mile days. On the second day, while short-cutting a switchback through a creek bed, I found just enough water to make the trip \"comfortable\".

The Bighorn Fire made a huge impact on both sides of the mountain. I've been trying to keep fire damage outta the frame this trek, but hard to deny this. That's one reason why I did this trek: who knows how much longer the trail will be sans fire damage. A rough count had me thinking more sections have fire damage than those without, even from fires a decade past.

Summerhaven is a cool getaway. The general store is the only place of interest currently open, but that's just fine since it had everything I could want. I went with my their caramel fudge and THAT Brewery's Trail Ale for dessert. Thankfully, the helpful people at the general store let me know about a place to sleep for the night that wasn't miles away and wouldn't be bothered by the authorities.

It's a relief to say good-bye to the desert, if only for 24-36 hours while I treat my blisters. Maybe by the time I drop back down there will be a cold front, some clouds, or even rain - can't hurt to dream üòÅ
