DAY 40 - Mica Mountain

Stopped almost 6 miles short of the base last night which meant a 4000 ft ascent during hottest part of the day - too much time spent filtering water from a stock pond and addressing my blisters. I wasn't expecting next water until a spring at 8000 ft. Fortunately, Tanque Verde Canyon (pronounced "thank you very") had plenty of water at 5000 ft - better to be lucky than good 😁

After lounging there until 4pm, I beasted up the mountain, hoping to reach the summit by sunset. Was thinking might be able to see the sunset & moonrise at about the same time, but I think I'm a day or two late for that. Did catch the moonrise, though.

I could've made Manning Camp, but the photos were giving me Friday the 13th vibes, especially considering full moon and the start of Spooktober 😬

Hard to believe October is already here and that we're a week into fall, although still feels too much like summer still. I forgot what clouds look like!
