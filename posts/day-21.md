From Blue Ridge to Mogollon Rim is a nice section, especially during raspberry season which I'm a bit late for.

I've never spent much time below the rim. What a nice surprise to find cool, clean water at this time of year! Went from feeling like high desert to rain forest in just minutes. Definitely coming back to explore this area some more.

We've got clear skies again. Hopefully that means good news for California - I'm behind on the news.

Spiders kept me company. They were harmless but still scary to see them crest my sleeping bag right in front of my face while reading my kindle ðŸ˜¬ Next stop: Pine
