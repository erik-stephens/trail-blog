DAY 23 - Grind to East Verde

Fell into the resupply trap again of buying too much food and overloading my pack. Was slogging all day. Pushed through the night trying to get to East Verde River but lost the trail. With no moon, I got turned around and bushwhacked in circles for 15 minutes or so before giving up and plopping down in a spot with as few rocks I could find. Thought it'd be warm enough to use sleeping bag as pillow only, but still had to curl up in it mid night. I'll be spending more time eating & drinking my pack weight down tomorrow üòÅ
