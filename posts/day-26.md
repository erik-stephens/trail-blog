DAY 26 - Naked & Afraid

Since leaving Pine 3 days ago, I only logged 45 miles which left me 30 miles to reach Sunflower to rendezvous with my bro in 24 hours for some rest. Good news is that it was primarily downhill and I ate & drank my pack weight down considerably.

Being greeted by a completely naked hiker on the trail also added a little pep to my step üòÅ Apologies for not getting a selfie or asking for his story. I was trying so hard not to make eye contact. I'm going to assume he was training for Naked & Afraid. That, or is a druid that doesn't like his clothes stretched when shape-shifting into a bear.

Reached the highest point (7152 ft) of this stretch. These kinds of ascents & descents are nothing for peak baggers, especially at that altitude, but were a challenge for me. Summiting Mazatzal Peak might be @eferesen
worthy since I didn't see any established routes to it.
