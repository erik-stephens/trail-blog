DAY 13 - High Desert

Finally caught a glimpse of the San Fransisco Peaks and some friends on the trail: Badgey, Wolfey, and Beetlejuicey. Hoping Snekey doesn't crash the party in the middle of the night. First time seeing a badger in my life - wasn't shy at all! I didn't get too close cuz I'm skeered.

This might be first night I have to break out the bug net. Hopefully they're just bugging me for their soc-med fix 😁
