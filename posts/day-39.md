On the menu today was a 12 mile stroll down the hwy to Hirabayashi Campground for the mid-day "wait for the sun to not be so angry" rest. This is where I got back on the AZT. It's an old prisoner camp. If I wasn't so tired & hot, I would've explored some more. I did score some trash water, not for drinking, but for freshening up my dirty socks.

I resisted the urge to shortcut the switchbacks, which was wise - would've been a steep descent among the hoodoos. I got back on the trail about 7 miles in. Since there aren't any promising water sources twix here and Mica Mountain, I did go off trail to see if Bug Spring had water - springs have been really good to me this trek. This was no exception but there was a black rattler napping right next to it...

I explained to it how I promised my mama that I wouldn't do anything too dangerous. It graciously said "No worries, mate! Let me move a bit outta the way so you can do your thing. Don't wanna worry your mum." Those Aussies sure are friendly!

After cameling up there and packing out 4+ liters, I feel much more comfortable reaching Manning Camp with plenty of water by tomorrow afternoon. Just 10-12 miles tonight through the valley to "base camp" for a cool ascent in the morning.
