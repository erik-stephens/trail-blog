Got a late start dealing with laundry, bathing, and my buried resupply. Some ants made it into a few things, but I won't complain about a little extra protein üòÅ

The late start (9am) meant 12 miles to a newly built rain water collector during the hottest hours. I lugged 4-5 liters of water there and rationed just in case it was empty and I'd need to wait until Gila River in another 10 miles.

In the moments where I was worried about overheating, a gentle breeze would turn my soaked shirt into a nice swamp cooler for a moment, helping me make it to the collector without dying.

The collector was awesome, providing plenty of water (and shade)! I lazed around it for 2-3 hours, eating my pack weight down. Some hunters doing some scouting drove by and hooked me up with an ice cold beverage (so f'ing good) and some different snacks to complement my same old food.

Too bad I had to finish the last few miles in the dark cuz there were some cool rock formations that seemed to come outta nowhere - tried to take a pic of one that looked just like a Dune worm.

Even though was hot & sweaty, it felt good to be in classic desert setting, where the cacti greet ya with open arms and the scrubs happily line the trail and give gentle low 5's üòÅ

Apologies for the post spam - signal had been really weak. All caught up now. Next stop: Gila River!
