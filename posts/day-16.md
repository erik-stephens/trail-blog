A nice, chill day making it through Flagstaff to Marshall Lake on the other side of The Peaks now. Bought way too much food (and beer) - never thought eating & drinking would feel like such a chore, but it was, if only to get weight off my pack sooner.

Was nice that so many FUTS were given - that's Flagstaff Urban Trail System. Didn't have to spend much time on surface streets looking like a bum üòÅ Definitely good day hike/bike opportunities without having to hop in the car.
