Made it to this lookout tower the day before meeting up with the fam for some rest, relaxation, and resupply.  Can see Vishnu Temple in the Grand Canyon. So far, this stretch is much more forested than I imagined - expected more of a high desert terrain.  Picking back up tomorrow afternoon to work my way back to Flagstaff over next few days. Hoping to get into a groove now that I survived the shock of the first 100 miles.
