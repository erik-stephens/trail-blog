The start of week 3 couldn't be better.  This stretch of the trail is awesome. Looks really fun for mountain biking as well.

Made it to Flagstaff, specifically Buffalo Park (tonight's camp site) just in time to raid the grocery store for a couple of Kilt Lifters - I can literally feel the hairs growing on my chest ðŸ˜‰

Now that I'm sorta back on track, I'm hoping to relax about the mileage/time and enjoy the trail more. A cold front is coming in with lows in the 30's ðŸ˜¬ I almost didn't bring a sleeping bag cuz "summer"!
