The thought of tapping out before reaching the South Rim had my amygdala & ego swollen to all time highs over the past week. Happy to report that I survived the Grand Canyon ðŸ˜…

I packed a bit over 4 liters of water cuz I want sure how much I'd need. Could've gone with 2 pretty comfortably.

It WAS a tough hike out for me, but not nearly as tough as I thought it would be. Definitely helped to do in the morning with fresh legs and  after letting the canyon cool overnight.

Included a little video to help get a sense of the steepness of the trail. I'm afraid of heights, so I didn't get too close to the edge, but I think I freaked out my phone...

Somewhere between the rim and Tusayan, my Pixel 3a stopped recognizing its SIM card. Trying to troubleshoot from the one spot in town that offers wifi: Big E's Steakhouse. Anyone wanna play tech support for me? With no SIM, it would be too old-timey (ie difficult) for me to trek to Flagstaff from here.

Maybe that's what I get for cheating a bit by hitching a ride a few miles into Tusayan. Thank you @shannakurtz for graciously giving my tired feet a well deserved respite - and I didn't even have my thumb out! I hope I didn't stink up your ride!
