Lack of reliable cell coverage between here and the South Rim means a bunch of posts at once...

Seeing that Utah-Mexico sign put some pep into my step. Even though I'd only gone 60 miles, it felt like a small milestone to see the canyon. 

Saw a coyote and some wild turkeys but couldn't get close enough for a good pic. Got some nice rain and a bit of hail. Made it to a lookout tower just before the sun set.

P.S. apologies if too many cloud pics but we can go months in Phoenix without seeing a single one.

P.S.S. pray for rain!
