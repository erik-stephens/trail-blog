This stretch from Superior to Oracle has had me puckered up ever since I started planning. I was hoping for SOME rain or at least cool enough temperatures by the time I got here. Got neither.

Even though I cheated a bit by going the route I took, I don't care now that I'm on the other side safe & sound. I did have to pay the hiking gods in the form of a bloody blister ðŸ˜¬

With that blister and the hwy hiking, it was a slog to get back to the trail. It was so nice cuz it was at an underpass next to a hiker box even. That underpass was the coolest, darkest, quietest spot I would find until Mt Lemmon, so I rested there until happy hour at the Orehouse Hilltop Tavern.

Took all my will power not too scavenge the awesome nuts & bolts I found along the tracks & hwy.

Have to say good-bye to my desert/sun shirt. He served me well. R.I.P.  On to unearth my penultimate resupply tonight and begin my ascent.
