DAY 38 - Done Blazing

After eating & drinking (only 8 beers) my fill in Summerhaven, it was time to move on. A huge thanks to General Store for letting me loiter while charging my batteries!

Since the trail from there to Gordon Hirabayashi Campground looked pretty ravaged by the fire, I decided to take the hwy down - would give my blisters a bit more time to heal as well.

Not wanting it to be too boring, I took a "short cut" south outta Marshall Gulch called "Sky Island Traverse" on Google maps. It started out as a trail but soon turned into yet another gnarly bushwhack. Wasn't my fault this time. If there ever was such a trail, nature has long since reclaimed it.

Stopped at San Pedro Vista for the night. Maybe it was the full moon, but there were quite a few moonlight trysts for a Wednesday night. Two guys pulled up to get stoned and then shortly after a van pulled up. My imagination got the best of me and I started worrying that I would be witness to some sort of illegal deal: "What if I heard something I shouldn't have and what if they see me?!?" I was behind a stone wall, so I clutched my mace & knife for an hour until they blazed out. A few minutes later, another couple pulls up and starts chatting literally 3 feet above me. They had no clue I was there, so I spoke up this time so they wouldn't freak out and so I could get some peace.

Needless to say, I survived the night. Looking forward to getting back on the trail away from hoomans - ants make for better bed company üòÅ
