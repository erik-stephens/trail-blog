DAY 3 - Kaibab Plateau

I think this is where I picked up my little friend.  Was more than happy to drink this water (filtered) after the long day of almost full sun, few water sources, and a trail with rocks just big enough to give my arches a not-so-gentle massage. The kinetic tape helped a bit.

Still lots of fire damage from about 10 years ago (I think). Will be cool once the aspen are full grown, though.

I think I'm caught up now. Back to my regularly scheduled program of getting my arse kicked by The Canyon 😁 Not issuing camping permits so I'll have to do it in a day 😭
