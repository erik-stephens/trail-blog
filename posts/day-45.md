It's hump day and I climbed over highest Mt Wrightson point that the AZT goes through then bombed down the other to get to Patagonia in time for a cold beverage and resupply.

It's clear why they call this area "Sky Islands" since there are so many ridges. It's probably got nothing on the Rockies, but still cool, especially for being in the middle of the desert.

As excited as I was to reach town, I was just as excited to leave it. Didn't live up to any of the hiker hype at all. Now I feel bad for calling Vail "just a suburb". Silver lining is that I snapped my first sunset that somewhat resembles an iconic AZ sunset.

About 5 miles before town, Google Fi said "Welcome to Mexico!" Since Google is never wrong, I guess I'm done ðŸ¤ª
